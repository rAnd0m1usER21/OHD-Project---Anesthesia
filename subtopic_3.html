  <span class="info_text"><p>Anesthesia has become a revolutionary discovery and is now used in a majority of medical operations. As a modern common medicine utility, it is currently safely and easily distributed to patients. Additionally, anesthesia has evolved into its own independent field of study, partially due to William T.G. Morton's publicity upon the product. Now, entire college degrees and jobs are built on anesthesiology as a completely new field of science. Even today, nearly 180 years later, anesthesia is a major part of surgical procedures. William Mortonâ€™s ingenious discovery of anesthesia has completely changed the field of surgery and medicine forever.

    <span class="title_mark"><h2>Civil War</h2></span>
  <span class="info_text"><p>A notable example of anesthesia's benefits can be highlighted during the Civil War, in a time when anesthesia was still considered a new science. There was no specific instrument to administer the anesthesia, and people were still researching how to effectively and safely use it. However, anasthesia, notably chloroform was widely used in the war to cure the vast amount of injuies soldiers endured during battle.</p></span>

  <div class="left_text"><span class="title_mark"><h2>MODERN DAY</h2></span>
  <span class="info_text"><p>In the modern day, the field and discoveries of anesthesia have expanded considerably. When anesthesia was first found in America, doctors and surgeons basically only used general anesthesia. Today, however, there are four different types of anesthesia: local, regional, general, and sedation.

  <ul>
    <li><span class="define">General ~ </span> affects the entire body, rendering the patient unconscious and paralyzed for the surgeons to do their work safely.</li>
    <li><span class="define">Local ~ </span> affects small, specific areas of the body, such as a tooth or an eye.</li>
    <li><span class="define">Regional ~ </span> similar to local anesthesia, but on a larger scale. Regional anesthesia could be used for an entire limb.</li>
    <li><span class="define">Sedation ~ </span> Sedation is typically used for minor surgeries or when patients need to be relaxed. For sedation, there are three levels of intensity: minimal, moderate, and deep. Minimal sedation likely will keep you conscious, but relaxed. Moderate sedation will make you sleepy, and you may not remember all of the procedure. Deep sedation will put you to sleep, but not fully unconscious. Patients will likely not remember what happened while they were sedated.</li>
