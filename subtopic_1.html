Before 1846, surgical procedures were done without the use of anesthesia. Patients stayed conscious as doctors attempted to finish the surgery as quickly as they could. Sometimes, methods such as opium or alcohol intoxication were used to lessen the pain of the patients. Other times, sedatives were used.</p></span></div>
