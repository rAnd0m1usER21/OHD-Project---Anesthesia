    <h2>FIRST DOSE</h2></span><span class="info_text"><p>The very first European record of using anesthesia in a surgery was on October 16, 1846. The patient, who had a vascular tumor located on his neck, was about to receive a surgery to remove it. William T.G. Morton, a dentist who was present at the surgery, administered sulfuric ether with the consent of the patient, Glenn Abbott, and the surgeon, John Warren. With Abbott reporting to have not felt any pain or discomfort whatsoever, the trial was a large success, and doctors began to implement this revolutionary tool in their own operations.</p></span></div>

      <h2>THE BEGINNING OF ANESTHESIOLOGY</h2></span><span class="info_text"><p>After William Morton used sulfur ether as general anesthesia in a surgery, many other people in the medical industry experimented with different anesthesthetic agents, such as nitrous oxide (laughing gas), and the more common chloroform. However, Morton was considering a system for the regulation of anesthesia. He needed to find a way to prevent overdose, which was not unusual. He designed a flask made of glass which had a moveable wooden mouthpiece so that it could be opened and closed. Although his invention of an anesthesia regulation device was much appreciated among the medical community, Morton spent the rest of his life fighting for wealth and credit and eventually died broke in 1868. Regardless, Morton's ingenuity ultimately brought publicity among the now expansive field of anesthesiology.</p></span></div>

  
  <div class="left_text"><span class="title_mark"><h2>OTHER IMPLEMENTATIONS</h2></span><span class="info_text"><p>It is important to note that the concept of anesthesia was found in other countries before 1846. One of the first trustable records of using anesthesia was written in 1804 by a Japanese physician named Seishu Hanaoka. He used a herbal mixture consisting of monkshood and thorn apple to make his patients unconscious before performing surgery on them. It is recorded that Hanaoka performed many successful surgeries using anesthesia. Sedatives were found much earlier; in the 2nd century, a surgeon in China named Hua Tuo created mafeisan. Mafeisan was a sedative that possibly contained cannabis or monkshood. </p></span>
